# Assignment 1
The goal of this assignment is to illustrate a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics: measurement outcomes do not, in general, possess predetermined values prior to measurement—unless one is willing to accept the possibility of faster-than-light communication.

In order to do so, we will implement a simple implementation of a maximum entangled state called |GHZ⟩ state, and perform measurements on it using Qiskit.
